# Data-analysis-on-water
This is a data analysis project on a mortality and water hardness dataset programmed in R. 
I had to clarify the relationship between the hardness rates and mortality rates amongst 61 cities in the north and south of England. 
The data provided was collected in an investigation of environmental causes of disease. 
They show the annual mortality per 100,000 for males, averaged over the years 1958 to 1964, and the calcium concentration (in parts per million) in the drinking water for 61 large cities in England and Wales. The higher the calcium concentration, the harder the water.
